Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

Pymaceuticals

Written description of three observable trends based on the data


1.- Tumor Response to Treatment:
We can notice that Capomulin drug has a better reponse to diminish the tumor volume over a 45 days period it is little bit more than 35 mm3.
Followed by Infubinol with 65 mm3.

2.- Metastatic Spread During Treatment:   
The number of metastatic sites changes were observed over time for each treatment. We found that maximum change was for the drug Ketapril followed by Placebo. And the less number of sites were Infubinol and Capomulin.

3.- Survival During Treatment:
The numbers of mice still alive through the course of the treatment applied to a certain group of mice, and the Survival Rate was compared for each drug. We can observe that the survival rate was high for the drug Capomulin(83%) after 45 days of treatment followed by the drug Ketapril(45%). 
As a Chief Data Analyst for Pymaceuticals, Inc. I would recommend continue testing Capomulin and Ketapril, to re confirm their efficiency in Cancer treatment.
